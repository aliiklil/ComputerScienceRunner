## Description
ComputerScienceRunner is a Jump 'n' Run game, that I have made for a university project.
The goal of the game is to learn more about the curriculum of the Bachelor and Master in Computer Science.
It has 10 levels in total, each level representing one semester. There are always three questions at the end of each level.
